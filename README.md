# The effect of exposure to high temperature on gut microbiota in rats during heat acclimation

Heat acclimation (HA), a within life phenotypic adaptation to hot environmental conditions, is the best strategy to improve performance in a hot environment. Growing evidence indicates that that gut microbiome deserves greater contribution to the establishment of HA. However, to our knowledge, no studies have examined HA on gut microbiota. Our study explores changes on gut microbiota during HA for the first time based on 16S rRNA high-throughput sequencing technology. By comparing the composition and function of microbial community between HA and control (CR) subjects, we found that gut microbiota plays an essential role in the positive physiological adaptations of HA. Overall, we construct the first comprehensive relationship between HA and gut microbiota in a rat model, providing a new strategy for understanding the biological mechanism of HA.
